FOUNDER

“As a graduate of mechanical engineering, my passion for creative space has never been the easy one, which has pushed me into personal development on locally made metal fabrication humbly by the road side at a young age. I didn’t let the challenges i encountered deter my determination to keep improving and honing my skills even in an economy that wasn’t supportive. Nevertheless, through blood, sweat and tears, we have evolved over the years.”
